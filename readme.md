## Intro
This is a template for online experiments at the Neural Computation Lab at UCR. This bypasses the use of PsiTurk and interfaces with mTurk directly.<br>

## Credit
Most of the code in this folder is from Jason Carpenter ( https://github.com/jmcarpenter2 ), who kindly shared the code that he wrote with us such that we are able to run experiments online without using PsiTurk. Thank you Jason! <br>

I modified some of Jason's code to make it fit a template form such that others in the lab are able to use it more easily.<br>

## Instructions
This section will be coming soon.<br>
